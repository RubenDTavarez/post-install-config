Here we find the URL links  for the administrators/Agents to log in and perform their task and other link for the end users to summit their monitor their tickets.

    Roles: These are permissions granted to the Agents per department that they access to. Each role a set of permissions that can be changed by agents given that Role in association with a department they have access to. From the Admin panel > Agents > Roles. In the picture above the text we can see some roles and the type of access they have. You can create an unlimited amount of roles and group a set of permissions for the type access your team needs based on their roles.
